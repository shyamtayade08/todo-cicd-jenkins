# Todo App with Flask, Docker, and Jenkins CI/CD

* Technologies: Built using Python (Flask) and Docker for containerization
* Docker: Dockerized the app for easy deployment and management with docker build and docker run commands.
* CI/CD with Jenkins: Set up a Jenkins pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process with each code commit.
* Jenkins Pipeline: The pipeline pulls the code from GitHub, builds the Docker image, and deploys it to the server automatically.
